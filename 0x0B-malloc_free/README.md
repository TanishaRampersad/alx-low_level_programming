Malloc is used for dynamic memory allocation.
We use malloc when we dont know the amount of memory needed during compile time.
In this task we will:

Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory.
Write a function that concatenates two strings.
Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
